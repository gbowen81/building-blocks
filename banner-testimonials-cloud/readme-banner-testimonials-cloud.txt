This is a horizontal scrolling section where testimonials are arranged based on their length and their relative value (good/better/best). The user needs to input good/better/best into the classes for each testimonial. Font size increases with the relative value of the testimonial. The script will automatically check the length of the testimonial. The testimonial will then receive a grid container sized to accomodate the contents, and these containers will then be arranged as a densely packed grid.

The div containing the list of testimonials must appear twice in the html, and they are stacked horizontally. After the first div scrolls past, the animation repeats.  But the second div must be their to make the animation seamless while the tail end of the first div moves from one side of the screen to the other.
