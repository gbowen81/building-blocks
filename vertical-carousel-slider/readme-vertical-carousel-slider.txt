This slider runs through a list of elements in a vertical carousel. Thumbnails on the right can be used to select which element to display. The slider runs automatically until any thumbnail is click on. Thereafter, it doesn't advance any more (There's no build-in method to restart it). Each slide drops from above and exits below. The caption below the slide that corresponds to each slide slides in from the left and slides out to the right using css animations.
