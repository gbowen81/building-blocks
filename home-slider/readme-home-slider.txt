Each slide in this slider first has a transition causing it to partially fade to black, then there is another fade transition to the following slide, the following slide fades in, partially darkened, and then fades from black. Clicking the next/prev buttons causes the slider to pause and advance/regress. Clicking anywhere on the slide also causes it to pause. Whenever it's paused, a play button watermark appears over the slide. Clicking on this button starts the slideshow again.
